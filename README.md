# GAM312_Project

## Overview
This project is a maze running game in which the player must navigate the maze while dodging enemies and false doors. The project began in a school course which focused on using C++ for a majority of the interactions and mechanics and has been expanded upon using blueprints. This game showcases AI pathfinding for enemy units to patrol the maze, a basic damage and health system, simple UI/UX devleopment, and other smaller functions using both C++ and UE4's Blueprints.

## Skills I hope to Highlight

* Using C++ to develop in UE4
* AI development for enemies using a pathfinding system
* Basic system competency. Damage/ Health Systems, Collision Detection, etc
* UI/UX Creation
